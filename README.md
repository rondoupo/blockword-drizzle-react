# Welcome to our BlockWord Repository!

This project is sponsored by blockchain901.org.

## BlockWord Game Project
We are developing a word guessing game similar to the legacy game "Hangman". This game interacts across the web full stack. Our game incorporates several web systems including - drizzle, node.js, ethereum virtual machine, and react.js. 

## TruffleSuite

We are using the TruffleSuit IDE. It is a open source blockchain development tool found at trufflesuites.com.

## Drizzle

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## React

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

## BlockWord Contract

You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.

## Blockword

You can delete the current file by clicking the **Remove** button in the file explorer. The file will be moved into the **Trash** folder and automatically deleted after 7 days of inactivity.

# StackEdit.io Markdown extensions

StackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra **Markdown extensions**, providing you with some nice features.  You can disable any **Markdown extension** in the **File properties** dialog.

### This section is saved for future use. The UML Diagrams look fantastic. I hope we can make diagrams that show the state machine of our game.


## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
