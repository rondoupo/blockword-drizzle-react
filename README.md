# Welcome to our BlockWord Repository!

This project is sponsored by blockchain901.org. (https://blockchain901.org/)

## BlockWord Game Project
We are developing a word guessing game similar to the legacy game "Hangman". This project will teach us to design and develop a game on full stack web technologies. Our game incorporates several frameworks and programming languages including - drizzle, node.js, ethereum virtual machine, react.js, solidity, and javascript. 

## Truffle

We are using the Truffle development environment. It is a open source blockchain development tool. (https://www.trufflesuite.com/)

## Drizzle

Drizzle is collection of front-end libraries used to create decentralized applications (dapps). We are creating our dapp on the Ethereum blockchain network. The core of Drizzle is based on the Redux Store. (https://redux.js.org/api/store/)

## React

Drizzle uses prebuilt react components. We use the React javascript library to build our user interfaces that interact with Drizzle. (https://reactjs.org/)

## BlockWord Contract

Our BlockWord game uses an Ethereum contract written in Solidity. This contract will read, write and store data used in our Blockword game.

## Blockword

This is the word guessing game that will run in your web browser.
